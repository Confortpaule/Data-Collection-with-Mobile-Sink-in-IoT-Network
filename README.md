# Data-Collection-with-Mobile-Sink-in-IoT-Network
In this code, we first visualize our dataset composed of 53 nodes coming from intel laboratory of sensors, then we apply the unsupervised learning algorithm called Kmeans based on the creation of clusters taking into account the Euclidean distance between the nodes, we obtain k=3 as the best value of k designating the number of clusters or groups; Then, we proceed to the designation of the leader in each cluster, this is done by comparing two methods of selection on 7000 iterations, the first one being the random method allowing to choose at each iteration, the leader still called the cluster head in a random way and our method based on the designation as cluster head from the second iteration a node whose residual energy (still considered as the remaining energy of a node after a request of transmission or reception of energy), After designating each cluster leader at each iteration we apply ant colony algorithm to find the shortest path by initializing the distance matrix as the distance matrix between the different cluster heads, for this we also consider a single ant which is here our mobile sink, the evaporation coefficient which is 0. 95 and as a result, we see that our method increases the lifetime of the network and also ant colony allows to designate efficiently the shortest path.
